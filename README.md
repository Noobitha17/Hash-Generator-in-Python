# Hash-Generator-in-Python
A hash is a function that converts one value to another. Hashing data is a common practice in computer science and is used for several different purposes. Examples include cryptography, compression, checksum generation, and data indexing. Hashing is a natural fit for cryptography because it masks the original data with another value. A hash function can be used to generate a value that can only be decoded by looking up the value from a hash table. The table may be an array, database, or other data structure. A good cryptographic hash function is non-invertible, meaning it cannot be reverse engineered. I am studdying in college and sharing my GUI hash geneartor in Python. Generate the hashes like MD5,SHA1,SHA2,SHA3 ,Blake2b from your desktop and create your own rainbow table.

## Features
1. Hash Generation for any String
2. Supported Hashing Algorithms MD5,SHA1,SHA2,SHA3 ,Blake2a and Blake2b
3. Helps in Development of Rainbow Table

### To Run the Script

cd Hash-Generator-in-Python  
sudo python hash_generator.py
